# CityGuide

CityGuide is a trip planning platform built with React, Next.js, and Node.js, and TypeScript.  CityGuide solves the challenge of creating personalized travel itineraries by allowing users to input their destination, dates, preferences, and must-see attractions. The application then generates a tailored itinerary based on these inputs, streamlining the often overwhelming process of planning a trip and ensuring travelers don't miss out on their desired experiences.

I hope this enables people to explore more.
